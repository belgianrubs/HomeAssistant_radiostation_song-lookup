# HomeAssistant: get a song that's playing on your favorite radiostation
Hello everyone

First of all, I want to thank Lewis from Everything Smart Home and his whole community. If you aren't already, you should definitely join his awesome Discord server: https://discord.gg/Bgfvy2f and see his good tutorials and videos: https://www.youtube.com/c/EverythingSmartHome/videos .
If you got some questions about this guide/code you can contact me or other community members about the code via the #home-assistant channel on the Discord server I mentioned.

You can find the guide, in guide.txt. 

The end result of this guide goes to something that should like this (which is based on a topic from the HA forum https://bit.ly/38UJOug ):

added some things to the code so the media_player card would look nicer:

and this, which is an addition I made with some help from ESH's Discord members:
